Evidence from a Chinese Experiment*, where the authors evaluate the performance effect of giving Chinese call-center employees the opportunity to work from home. To do this, they first asked the employees whether they would generally be willing to work from home. Of those employees who volunteered to work from home, they **<u>randomly</u>** chose a **subgroup** which was actually given the **opportunity to work from home** (**treatment group**). Those employees who **volunteered**, but were **not given the opportunity to work from home**, serve as the **control group**."
