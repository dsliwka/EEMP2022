## Empirical Evaluation of Management Practices

### University of Cologne

#### Winter 2022/23

_Prof. Dr. Dirk Sliwka and Sander Kraaij_

### Organizational issues

-   Sessions take place on _Mondays (14:00-15:30, 16:00-17:30)_ and _Tuesdays (10:00-11:30)_ during the first term of the semester.
	- **NOTE: Mondays & Tuesdays: Seminar room 3.206 in the SSC building **
<!-- -   **All sessions will take place in seminar room 3.206 on the 3rd floor of the SSC building, not in the room stated on the official KLIPS schedule.** -->
-   Please bring a laptop as you will be working with python yourself.
-   We will be using Google Colab throughout the course, **including the exam**.
	-   You can find information about this service [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).
	-   Please bring a laptop (or tablet with keyboard) to all sessions because we will be interactively working with python in Google Colab.
	-   Since Google Colab requires an internet connection, please make sure yours is working.
	-   Google Colab also requires a Google account. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free. You do not need to add any personal information to your account if you do not want to.
-   **Exam dates:**
    -   November 29, 2022, 10:00-11:00
    -	March 15, 2023, 10:00-11:00
